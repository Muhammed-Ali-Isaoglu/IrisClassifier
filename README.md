Project Overview

The aim of the project is to build a classification model using the well-known Iris dataset for the purpose of detecting different types of irises. 

This project is an introduction to the classification techniques of machine learning and at the same time it is also an exemplar of the different Python tools such as the pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, which are used for data processing, and visualization and modeling.

Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics. It holds 150 samples, with three different iris species, as follows: setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Four features are the measurements of each sample:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The dataset provided as part of the scikit-learn library is available.

Model Selection

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) has been employed as the algorithm in the project. This choice of a model takes its roots in the facts that it is a very simple model but, on the other side, it is also a very powerful tool for the multi-class classification problem. 

After training, the modelâ€™s accuracy was then checked with the test set. The confusion matrix was depicted visually using a heatmap in order to look at the correct and incorrect predictions.

Key Results

Accuracy: [100%]
